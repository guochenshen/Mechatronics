    <ul>
      <li>Locomote on a window autonomously</li>
      <li>Traverse a barrier to reach adjacent windows</li>

    <h1>Problem</h1>

    <p>Window washers are constantly subjected to hazardous conditions resulting from high heights, the use soup, water, and other cleaning materials, and support structures that are very easily subject to failure. Window washing is also considered the most dangerous job in the UK [1]. The act of window washing itself is repetitive, monotonous, and generally involves the use of harsh chemicals in outdoor environments, making the task far more suitable for a machine that a human being. Our team proposes an innovative, robotic solution to address this task in the hopes of eliminating the risk associated with window washing.</p>

    <h1>Requirements</h1>
      <h2>The requirements that the device must meet are:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatically wash one side of a multi-section window with sizes from 3'x5' to 6'x5'.</li>
        <li>Take up a footprint of less than 2 square feet.</li>
        <li>Cannot contact the ground.</li>
        <li>Not scratch or damage surface of the window.</li>
        <li>Function without external installation of infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Cover and clean 100% of the window at a speed of 10 square feet per minute.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The testing stand constists of a pane of glass bordered by 2"x2" 80/20 aluminum framing. The barrier that divides the pane will be a 2"x1" 80/20 divider.The device must also be able to traverse this barrier and clean the other side.</p>

    <h1>Functional Architecture</h1>

    <img src="images/funcarch.png">

    <p>Our device is comprised of several functional subsystems. These subsystems work together to achieve the system requirements of the device.</p>
    <p>The controller controls the device and all of its components and functions. It takes in information from all of the sensor and uses this to correctly operate the device. This information includes its absolute position on the window, using ultrasonic sensors to take the measurements. It also takes information in from an IMU, giving it angle. Based on these two pieces of information, the system can make adjustments and corrections if it every strays from the path, allowing it to accurately move along to clean the window.</p>
    <p>This controller operates the locomotion system, which consists of the wheels and motors. This system, combined with the suction system, allows the system to move about on the surface on which its attached. These high torque motors allows the device to remain firmly attached to the window via suction, while still moving around.</p>
    <p>The device is also attached to the cleaning subsystem, which enables the device to clean the surface of the window while it moves around on the surface. Initially, the cleaning system was required to remove dirt from the surface. This required a more complex system that allowed the system to remain effective even with dirt. However, with the new dirt material, the cleaning system can be simplified due to the ease in which washable marker is removed.</p>

    <h3>Cyberphysical Architecture</h3>

    <img src="images/cyberarch.jpg">

    <p>All components of the Windchill are controlled using an Arduino Mega, which uses a 8-bit processor and has numerous analog and digital pins, more than enough for the amount of sensors and components that we want to use.</p>
    <p> For the navigation and boundary detection sensor system, ultrasonic sensors are used. Ultrasonic sensors (Parallax PING sensors that provide fairly accurate distance measurements) are placed on the all four sides of the robot and mounted close to the surface to detect the separator and edges of the window. An IMU (BNO055) is used to determine to angle of the device. Combining the data from the IMU and the ultrasonic sensors, we are able to determine the absolute position of the device on the surface of the window.</p>
    <p>The IMU used by the controller is a BNO055, again on a breakout board provided by Pololu. This chip communicates over I2C, using the SDA and SCL pins on the Arduino. The chip provides absolute angular position, which is done by sensor fusion that the manufacturer has already done.</p>
    <p>By using this data, Windchill can move itself across the window in a “lawnmower” path to clean every part of the window autonomously.</p>

    <h3>System Description</h3>

    <p>Our device is composed of three separate subsystems that allow us to sense our environment, move across window surface, and traverse barriers separating individual window panes. All three subsystems are attached to a main, rectangular chassis. Although all pictures below are of our design Protoype 2.0, the same setup would be implemented in our final, carbon fiber prototype.</p>

    <h3> Sensing </h3>
      <p>Our sensing system is composed of four ultrasonic sensors placed along the sides of the robot chassis, an IMU (inertial measurement unit) sensor placed in its center, and two limit switches. By determining each sensor’s distance from the nearest barrier, we are able to calculate the robot’s overall position within a given window pane. The IMU checks that the robot is level with the surface of window and, when turning, ensures that the robot returns to one of 4 fixed orientations: forward, backward, left, and right. This system allows our robot to always remain in a fixed position, orthogonal the barriers surrounding the window, enables our robot to move along the window in a lawnmower-like pattern, and allows it to robustly handle cases in which the robot might slip along the window. Finally, the two limit switches at the front of the chassis insure that parallel contact with the barrier is achieved before initializing barrier crossing.</p>

      <img src="images/sysdes_sensing.png">

    <h3>Locomotion</h3>
      <p>Our robot is able to move along a window’s surface due to a customized suction system and high-torque motors that work in tandem to ensure that robot will remain fixed to window’s surface while still able to drive itself forward. The suction system consist of a funnel to provide large surface area contact with the window and a dual-lip, Teflon-coated sealing system that allows the funnel to slide along the windows surface but ensures no loss of contact with that surface. It is attached directly to a vacuum system by a free rotating joint that provides the robot mobility in turning. The high-torque motors in this locomotion subsystem are connected to deformable wheels that also allow a significant amount of surface area to remain in contact with the window, ensuring the traction necessary to move.</p>

      </figure>

    <h3>Obstacle Traversal</h3>
      <p> Our barrier crossing system is composed of actuated gripper arms that move along a guide rail. There are two rails along the left and right side walls of the robot and each rail is also actuated by servo arms that allow the robot to push its rail downwards, thereby moving the body of the chassis upward. The gripper arms allow sufficient contact with the obstacle by actuating its fingers into the T-slots of the 8020 rod barrier. Its material insures that it will be able to handle the loads generated by the robot while traversing the barrier. Lastly, a stepper motor with a dual capstan attaches to the gripper arm and is capable of moving the arm along the length of the rail, such that, as the arm drives towards the back of the robot’s chassis, the chassis itself will move forward with respect to the arm.</p>

    <h1>System Implementation</h1>

    <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
      <p>Prototype 1 was produced with a laser cut base and various representative cutouts that did not perform any meaningful functions. It was designed primarily to demonstrate an overall form factor and functional motor and sensor operation.</p>
      <p>The chassis was produced with a 1/4" laser cut base, and had cutouts that were supposed to represent the various areas that the system would attach to. The front, representing the cleaning system, had a limit switch mounted to it to allow the device to detect any structure that it contacts in the front.</p>
      <p>The electronics consisted of an Arduino Mega and a motor driver, driving the two motors on the side. The motors provided locomotion capabilities on horizontal surfaces. The wiring was accomplished via breadboards and jumper wires.</p>
      <img src="images/p1.jpg">

    <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
      <p>Prototype 2 builds upon Prototype 1 by adding structures that permit the device to clean, move, and suction. This system also has provisions for attachment of the gripper systems.</p>
      <p>The structure was again manufactured from a 1/4" acrylic sheet. This structure had provisions for modularity, with a removeable suction funnel holder, and interchangeable motor mounts, allowing the device to change motors when new motors arrived.<p>
      <p>The funnel in the center is what connects to the vacuum system, giving the system suction to properly suction onto the surface of the window. Due to our ability to use offboard suction, we are using an offboard vacuum to suction onto the window to save weight on our device.</p>
      <p>The structure had provisions for mounting more components onto the system, including ultrasonic sensors and limit switches on the front. Unfortunately, due to a test trial that caused the device to detatch from the window, the front of the device and some wiring connections suffered damage. However, this prototype, despite the damage sustained, is still capable of moving on the surface of the window. Most of the sensors still worked, however, and communicated information over Bluetooth to a receiving computer.</p>
      <img src="images/p2.jpg">

    <h2>Prototype 3</h2>
      <p>Prototype 3 demonstrates more solidified electronics wiring and mounting, refined suction system, and improved motion on the surface. It also makes provisions (such as a larger dimensions of 14x14) for the new gripper system that will allow the device to cross the barrier. Allow the gripper attachment is not depicted on this page, it can be viewed in Milestone 5.</p>
      <p>It is be similar in construction to the previous prototypes with an acrylic baseplate. However, all of the mounting and attachment pieces will be made from metal, 3D printed parts or stock parts designed for the equipment we want to mount.</p>
	<img src="images/prototype_3/proto_3.jpg">

    <h2>Prototype 4</h2>
      <p>Prototype 4, shares the same generally functionality as prototype 3. However, the obstacle traversal system was moved in order to cut scope and focus on locomotion performance for the final demonstration.</p>
	<p>The base is a carbon fiber reinforced polymer, with two layers of carbon fiber on each side, bonded to a Rohacell high density foam core. Improvements were made to the wheel tires to improve traction and wiring was also simplified.</p>
