<h1>Motor Lab <small>2/10/2016</small></h1>
<p>To demonstrate proficiency with motors, our team was tasked with running 3 different types of electric motors: DC motor with encoder, servo, and stepper motor. Each motor was slightly different in how it operated, as well as how we controlled it. We were also tasked with creating a GUI that could control the motors using serial commands. Sensors were also integrated into the system, with 3 different sensors capable of controlling the motors.</p>
<p>For the DC motor with encoder, we needed to interface with a motor driver that handled the high amounts of current needed to drive the motors. This chip was controlled by our Arduino, and would read from the encoder via interrupts, keeping track of the readings from the quadrature encoder.</p>
<p>The servo was directly connected to the Arduino board itself, requiring no external power. A servo library was used to dictate how many degrees we wanted the servo to be rotated.</p>
<p>The stepper motor, like the DC motor, required a separate driver as well. This one we needed to wire up ourselves. Once the driver was made, an Arduino library was used to control the stepper motor, controlling the speed and how many steps.</p>
